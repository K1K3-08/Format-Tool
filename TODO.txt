-V1 req:

	-Format converter//
		-Open xls file and convert to a dataframe //
		-Clean dataframe//
		-Pass only relevant information to the excel with the manufacturing order (Use example manufacturing order)//


	-UI w pywebview==
		-Load File w sys dialog
		-Select format to convert to another selected format
		-Download converted file w sys dialog

	-Compile app



Once v1 is done present it and get feedback on it, ask for desired features, other formats, and propose your ideas.

Future versions ideas(do not develop w/o feedback):

	-Ask if observation are different every time or do they stay for the most part the same
		-Taking note of the observations made to the manufacturing order and pair them with their corresponding product name and product code and saving that so the observation is added by default next time
		-Adding observations on the app so they can be recorded
	-Ask how shipping dates are decided and possibly automate it
		-Add option to edit shipping date on the app
	-Auto updates so I can update the app remotely and resolve issues
		-git pull of compiled files? TBD
	-SAE integration TBD
		-SAE model generation?
		-SAE api usage?
	-Ask how manufacturing orders are categorized
		-is it one by purchase order or is it multiple that get separated by product type
